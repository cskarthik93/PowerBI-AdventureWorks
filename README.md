# PowerBI-AdventureWorks
 AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. Our role is to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

We follow the key stages of the business intelligence workflow, and simulate real-world tasks that data professionals encounter on the job

**Connecting & Shaping Data**
In this stage we’ll focus on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load our project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:

1. Data connectors
2. Storage & import modes
3. Query editing tools
4. Table transformations
5. Connecting to a database
6. Extracting data from the web
7. QA & Profiling tools
8. Text, numerical, date & time tools
9. Rolling calendars
10. Index & conditional columns
11. Grouping & aggregating
12. Pivoting & unpivoting
13. Merging & appending queries
14. Data source parameters
15. Importing Excel models


**Creating a Relational Data Model**
In stage 2 we’ll review data modeling best practices, introduce topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and begin to build our AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:

1. Database normalization
2. Fact & dimension tables
3. Primary & foreign keys
4. Star & snowflake schemas
5. Active & inactive relationships
6. Relationship cardinality
7. Filter context & flow
8. Bi-directional filters
9. Model layouts
10. Data formats & categories
11. Hierarchies

**Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**
In stage 3 we’ll introduce data analysis expressions (DAX). We’ll create calculated columns and measures, explore topics like row and filter context, and practice applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:

1. DAX vs. M
2. Calculated columns & measures
3. Implicit, explicit & quick measures
4. Measure calculation steps
5. DAX syntax & operators
6. Math & stats functions
7. Conditional & logical functions
8. The SWITCH function
9. Text functions
10. Date & time functions
11. The RELATED function
12. CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL
13. Iterator (X) functions
14. Time intelligence patterns

**Visualizing Data with Reports**
Stage 4 is about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. We’ll review data viz best practices, building and format basic charts, and add interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:

1. Data viz best practices
2. Dashboard design framework
3. Cards & KPIs
4. Line charts, trend lines & forecasts
5. On-object formatting
6. Table & matrix visuals
7. Conditional formatting
8. Top N filtering
9. Map visuals
10. Drill up, drill down & drillthrough
11. Report slicers & interactions
12. Bookmarks & page navigation
13. Numeric & fields parameters
14. Custom tooltips
15. Importing custom visuals
16. Managing & viewing roles (RLS)
17. Mobile layouts
18. Publishing to Power BI Service

We’ll also use powerful artificial Intelligence tools like decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives and natural language Q&A, along with performance optimization techniques to keep our reports running smoothly at scale!
